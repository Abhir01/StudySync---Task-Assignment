# Color Scheme

The color scheme follows a balanced approach with a primary, secondary, and accent color. The primary color provides a strong visual identity, while the secondary color complements it to maintain readability. Accent colors are used sparingly for emphasis, such as on buttons and hover states.

various colors used are: 
--primary-color: #6366F1;
--accent-color: #3f83f8;
--text-color: #333333;
--link-color: #2563eb;
--background-color: #ffffff;
--light-gray: #f0f0f0;
--gray: #808080;
--dark-gray: #555;

# Typography

The typography selection ensures readability and a professional appearance. A sans-serif font is used for clean and modern aesthetics, 
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100;200;400;500;600;700&display=swap');

Headings: Larger and bolder to establish a clear visual structure.

Body Text: Readable, medium-weight text for ease of reading.

Buttons & Links: Slightly emphasized for clear interaction points.

# Layout Choices

The layout is designed with responsiveness in mind, using:

Flexbox/Grid: Ensuring content is structured efficiently and adapts well to different screen sizes.

Margins & Padding: Providing sufficient whitespace to enhance readability and avoid clutter.

Container Widths: Optimized for various devices, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile.

# Interactive Elements

Hover effects and transitions are used to enhance user interactions without being distracting. Buttons and links change subtly on hover to indicate interactivity, improving the user experience.
